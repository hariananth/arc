<p>On August 19th a video, titled "Message to America", was uploaded to YouTube. Despite it's immediate removal, copies and screenshots of the video spread across the web. Twitter actively removed all photos. LiveLeak, known for violent and disturbing content, wiped the video from its site.</p>

<p>The following day, the United States National Security Council confirmed the authenticity of the video.</p>

<p>From a podium at the Edgartown School in Martha's Vineyard, President Obama condemned the act and vowed justice.</p>

<p>"The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people.  We will be vigilant and we will be relentless.  When people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done."</p>

<p>The video and associated threat came from the newly established <a href="#compass-is">Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham</a>, or ISIS, a Sunni insurgent group claiming to be a global religious authority over all Muslims. They were currently carrying out attacks in Iraq and Syria against government forces and civilians alike.</p>

<p>In the video released by ISIS an American journalist, James Foley, is beheaded by Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, an ISIS soldier operating out of Syria. </p>

<p>Curiosity about the reality of places like Iraq, where his brother was serving as an officer in the US air force, first led James Foley to embed himself with US troops in such places of extreme conflict.</p>

<p>Before deciding to pursue journalism in the mid-2000’s, Foley was a teacher in Arizona, Massachusetts, and Chicago on behalf of the Teach for America program. As a journalist, he covered international events and conflict zones as commissioned by USAID. </p>

<p>In 2011, he traveled to Libya to cover <a href="#compass-gaddafi">the uprising against Col Muammar Gaddafi</a>, working closely with rebel fighters there.</p>

<p>"The idea with the Libyan revolution is, it's journalists embedding with rebels, and that's essentially what we did," he recalled.</p>

<h2 id="abdel-majed-badel-bary">Abdel-Majed Badel Bary</h2>

<p>Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, born 1990, is one of six children of Adel Abdel Bary, an Egyptian militant who is currently facing terrorism charges in connection with <a href="#compass-alqaeda">Al Qaeda’s twin 1998 bombings at the U.S. embassies</a> in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.</p>

<p>After years of torture in Egyptian prisons, the Bary's were granted political asylum and made Britian home. But after being connected to the 1998 US embassy bombings, Abdel was extradited to the United States in 2012.</p>

<p>By then, his son was a fledgling you rapper in the rapper. Going by L. Jinny, he had middling success, with his songs at time appearing on BBC radio. Rapping about drugs and alcohol, and at times, his brewing hatred for the West.</p>

<!--
[YouTube or something of him rapping?]

<p>“The day when they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two when I went to look back,” he rapped. “Imagine then I was only 6, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick.”</p>

<h1 id="main-narrative-1">Main Narrative</h1>

<p>A wave of uprisings rocked the Middle East following what the international community dubbed the “Arab Spring” of 2010. These protests centered around civilians dissatisfaction with corrupt leadership and militaristic regimes, and were further fueled by existing religious and ethnic divides.  </p>

<p>While most of these protests began as non-violent demonstrations, many of them elicited violent responses from government forces — some even resulting in civil war. Such was the case in Libya under the rule of Gaddafi and any form of opposition to the regime was handled swiftly by the military. </p>

<h1 id="foley-1">Foley</h1>

<p>In April 2011, Foley and three other Western journalists were ambushed by Gaddafi's forces in Libya, resulting in the death of one and the rest taken prisoner.</p>

<p>"A soldier's pressing your face into the bed of a truck, bleeding from the scalp — it's the worst kind of shock," Foley said afterwards.</p>

<p>For 18 days, it was unknown whether he was still alive.</p>

<p>Foley’s parents, Diane and John Foley, campaigned for his release, holding prayer vigils and working with US and Arab diplomatic teams to gather information.</p>

<p>After six weeks, Foley was released. But the resultant death of Anton Hammerl, his friend and colleague, had a profound impact on him.</p>

<p>"I'll regret that day for the rest of my life. I'll regret what happened to Anton," he said. "I will constantly analyse that."</p>

<p>His experience of being captured however did not deter him.</p>

<p>"It doesn't always repel you. Sometimes… it draws you closer. Feeling like you've survived something — it's a strange sort of force that you are drawn back to," he said.</p>

<p>Following his ordeal, he was eager to be back on the frontlines and this hunger for facts brought him to the developing crisis in Syria, getting ever closer to the violent ISIS insurgents. </p>

<h1 id="main-narrative-2">Main Narrative</h1>

<p>Beginning in the spring of 2011, uprisings spread across Syria in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, whose forces would respond with violent crackdowns. </p>

<p>The conflict gradually shifted from popular protests to an armed rebellion consisting of several different groups. One of these groups was ISIS, which originated in Iraq and quickly gained control of a third of Syria’s territory. </p>

<h1 id="abdel-1">Abdel</h1>

<p>Abdel Bary was said to have been first radicalized by Muslim groups in England. This is evident from the shift in content found in his music. He went from rapping about the London streets and marijuana use to siting revolution and blood on his hands.</p>

<p>As the situation in Syria became increasingly violent and civil war broke out, Bary announced his loyalty to Islam and those fighting against the Assad regime. </p>

<p>In July 2013, he posted on Facebook, “The Unknown mixtape with my bro Tabanacle will be the last music I’m ever releasing. I have left everything for the sake of Allah.” </p>

<p>Bary left his family’s $1-million-plus home west of London soon after to fight with the anti-Assad forces in the <a href="#compass-syria">Syrian Civil War</a>.</p>

<h1 id="main-narrative-3">Main Narrative</h1>

<p>ISIS originated as a splinter group from Iraq-based al Qaeda. It aims to create an Islamic state governed by Sharia law across Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria. ISIS is said to have been established in 2006, but it did not begin gaining significant advances in territory until 2013. In June of 2014 they quickly swept through northern Iraq and gained control of major cities Mosul, Tikrit, and the northeast corner of Syria.</p>

<h1 id="foley-2">Foley</h1>

<p>Foley was kidnapped for a second time in Syria in November 2012 along with his translator and British journalist John Cantile. The three men were working on a film profiling the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group that opposed Assad’s regime and radical Islamic groups such as ISIS.  Foley was believed to be captured by a militant group loyal to President Assad. </p>

<p>Foley’s captors demanded incredibly high ransoms from his family, his employers and the United States government. Foley’s family even went so far as to consider breaking US law and paying a ransom to ISIS after receiving threatening emails from ISIS soldiers. </p>

<p>In June 2014 a fellow hostage was released and recounted a memorized message from Foley to his family in which Foley described his captivity in a cell with several other hostages. This became known as his final letter and his family later posted it on their Facebook page shortly after his death. </p>

<h1 id="abdel-2">Abdel</h1>

<p>Little is known of Bary’s travels through Syria and how he came to affiliate with ISIS. However, he left a digital trail of Facebook posts and tweets that hint at his encounters with more than one rebel group and his gradual descent into violence.  </p>

<p>In March 2014, he claimed via Twitter that he had been kidnapped and tortured by the Free Syrian Army. Further tweets in August of 2014 revealed that he had joined up with radical ISIS insurgents — “The lions are coming for you soon filthy kuffs (infidels). Beheadings in your own backyard soon.” Later posting a picture of himself holding a severed head, it was evident that his radicalization was complete. </p>

<p>Main Narrative
A main focus of ISIS’s aggression has been towards the United States and its use of air strikes in the Middle East. In “Message to America,” in what sounds like a British accent a soldier states that “the life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”</p>

<p>Further videos have been released with the same British ISIS soldier threatening further deaths if the US does not stop strikes against ISIS. British papers stated that British intelligence agencies identified the soldier appearing in the videos as Abdel Bary, although it has not been confirmed by the British government. </p>

<p>With the US and other Western nations in talks to continue striking ISIS held territories in Iraq and Syria it is hard to say when such outspoken behavior by ISIS insurgents will stop. And with Abdel Bary’s whereabouts unknown it is possible that he is responsible for the beheadings of American journalists and that his violent behavior shows no signs of slowing. </p>

<h2 id="syrian-civil-war">Syrian Civil War</h2>

<p>The Syrian Civil War is an ongoing armed conflict taking place in Syria. The unrest began in the early spring of 2011 with nationwide protests against President Bashar al-Assad's government, whose forces responded with violent crackdowns. The conflict gradually morphed from popular protests to an armed rebellion after months of military sieges. The armed opposition consists of various groups that were formed during the course of the conflict, primarily the Islamic Front and the Free Syrian Army.</p>

<p>In 2013, Hezbollah entered the war in support of the Syrian army. In the east, the Islamic State (IS), a jihadist militant group originating from the Iraq War, made rapid military gains in both Syria and Iraq, eventually conflicting with the other rebels. In July 2014, ISIS controlled a third of Syria's territory and most of its oil and gas production, thus establishing itself as the major opposition force.</p>

<p>The Syrian government is upheld by military support from Russia, which was expanded in the winter of 2013–14, and Iran, while Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and United States transferred weapons to the rebels. The US, the UK and European and Arab states have declared a readiness to support the mainstream Syrian opposition. Owing to the nature of this involvement, the international response to the conflict has been described as a proxy war.</p>
